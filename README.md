# Ice Breakr
## Inspiration

We were inspired by the many awkward class and meeting introductions we've had over the course of the current pandemic. We created this website in hopes of solving this issue. We hope to help others across the globe break the ice online.

## What it does

Unsure of how to get your team acquainted at your first meeting? With Ice Breakr, you and your team can find the perfect way to "break the ice" even in a virtual setting. Ice Breakr is a brand new web service that is perfect for team meetings, classroom settings, or for any group seeking a fun and easy way to get to know one another.

## How we built it

We built this website using Firebase to host our HTML pages that we styled using CSS and Bootstrap and added functionality to using JavaScript.
